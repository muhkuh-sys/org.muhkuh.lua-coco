	 \brief led_analyzer handles all functionality on device level and provides the functions needed by the GUI application (header)
	 
The led_analyzer library will handle functionality to work with severeal color controller devices. It scans
for connected color controller devices and opens them. All devices that have been connected to will have handles. 
These handles will be stored in an array and can be used by all underlying color related functions. Furthermore this library
provides the functions which are required for the application CoCo App.
